Instruction Following: While the model attempted to implement a module for symbolic mathematics,
 it misaligned with the broader prompt requirements. The implementation is restricted to basic 
 polynomial operations and lacks general symbolic capabilities like handling trigonometric or
 logarithmic functions, as might be expected from a "symbolic mathematics" prompt.

Executability: The provided code is executable but contains logical flaws. For example:
Addition and Subtraction: Both produce incorrect outputs due to flawed term combination logic and lack 
of proper negation in subtraction.Integration: Lacks a constant of integration, a key requirement in 
indefinite integrals.Simplification: Redundant logic across methods makes the implementation inefficient 
and error-prone.

Correctness: The results (e.g., identical addition and subtraction outputs) are mathematically incorrect, 
and simplification of terms is improperly handled. The implementation doesn't sort terms, leading to inconsistent 
outputs.

Overall, the model demonstrated an ability to execute basic polynomial arithmetic but failed to address symbolic
 mathematics comprehensively. Clearer instruction-following and better logical rigor are required to meet the 
 prompt's intent.
