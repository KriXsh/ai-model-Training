Model Training Tasks
Task 1: Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
This task demonstrates how to train an image classification model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The script train_cnn.py allows you to train the model on a custom image dataset.

# Usage:
Prepare your image dataset in the specified format (e.g., directories representing classes).
Run the following command:

- Task 2: Text Classification with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
This task trains a text classification model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The script train_rnn.py processes textual data and performs classification.

# Usage:
Prepare a text dataset in CSV format (with columns for text and labels).
Run the following command:
